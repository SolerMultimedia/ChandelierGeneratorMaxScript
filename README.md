# ChandelierGeneratorMaxScript
This script allows you to create personalized chandeliers in 3D Studio Max. It was created using the MAXScript language. This was one of my very first attempts at programming in general, so the code is very poor as it could be a lot cleaner, shorter and way more polished; but i figured that it might be helpful to someone that is currently learning the language. There is a video showcasing how this script works on my YouTube channel.
